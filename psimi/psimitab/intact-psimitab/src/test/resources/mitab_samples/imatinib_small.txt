It is used in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and a number of other malignancies.It is the first member of a new class of agents that act by inhibiting particular tyrosine kinase enzymes, instead of non-specifically inhibiting rapidly dividing cells."|drug type:Small Molecule; Approved|drug category:Antineoplastic Agents; Protein Kinase Inhibitors|disease indication:"For the treatment of newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients with Ph+ chronic phase CML whose disease has recurred after stem cell transplant or who are resistant to interferon-alpha therapy. Also indicated with unresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)."|pharmacology:"Imatinib is an antineoplastic agent used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia. Imatinib is a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative that functions as a specific inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes. In chronic myelogenous leukemia, the Philadelphia chromosome leads to a fusion protein of Abl with Bcr (breakpoint cluster region), termed Bcr-Abl. As this is now a continuously active tyrosine kinase, Imatinib is used to decrease Bcr-Abl activity."|mechanism of action:"Imatinib mesylate is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, the constitutive abnormal tyrosine kinase created by the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in Bcr-Abl positive cell lines as well as fresh leukemic cells from Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Imatinib also inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and stem cell factor (SCF) - called c-kit. Imatinib was identified in the late 1990s by Dr Brian J. Druker. Its development is an excellent example of rational drug design. Soon after identification of the bcr-abl target, the search for an inhibitor began. Chemists used a high-throughput screen of chemical libraries to identify the molecule 2-phenylaminopyrimidine. This lead compound was then tested and modified by the introduction of methyl and benzamide groups to give it enhanced binding properties, resulting in imatinib."|comment:"drug absorption (MI:2045): Imatinib is well absorbed with mean absolute bioavailability is 98% with maximum levels achieved within 2-4 hours of dosing"|toxicity attribute name:"Side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, dry skin, hair loss, swelling (especially in the legs or around the eyes) and muscle cramps"|comment:"plasma protein binding (MI:2047):Very high (95%)"|drug metabolism:Primarily hepatic via CYP3A4.
